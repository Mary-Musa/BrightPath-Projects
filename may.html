            <h2>The Learning Trail: A Journey, Not a Race</h2>

            <p>Learning is a journey made of small steps. It does not happen all at once, and everyone moves at their own pace. <br>The Learning Trail is about staying curious, practicing often, and growing a little every day.

            Along the way, challenges are normal. <br>They help us learn, improve, and become more confident. <br> What matters most is not how fast you move, but that you keep going.

            <br>The Learning Trail reminds us that learning is a lifelong path — one step at a time.</p>

            <h2>consistency is Key</h2>

                <p>Learning works best when we practice regularly and stay consistent. <br> Small, repeated efforts each day add up to real progress. <br>Even when it feels slow or difficult, keeping a steady routine helps build strong skills and confidence. <br>Remember, success isn’t about speed—it’s about showing up, learning a bit more each day, and trusting the process.</p>
